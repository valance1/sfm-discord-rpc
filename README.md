# SFM Discord RPC

This repository contains the SFM Discord RPC project. SFM Discord RPC is a tool that allows you to display your current Source Filmmaker (SFM) session information as a rich presence on Discord. It enhances your Discord status by showing the current SFM map and the time spent working on your SFM project.
I want to credit https://github.com/niveshbirangal/discord-rpc for coding the connection between Discord and Python 3, I had to rewrite for compatibility 
with python 2.7.6, but my life was made easier thanks to his efforts.
